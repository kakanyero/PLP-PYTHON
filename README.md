# WEEK-1
# Simple Python Calculator

A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Features

- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles invalid operations gracefully
- Prevents division by zero errors
- Cleans user input automatically
- Displays results in a clear format

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment (Python 3.x required)
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. Choose an operation (+, -, *, /)
5. View the result

Example:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

## Error Handling

The program handles:
- Invalid operations (shows error message)
- Division by zero (shows error message)
- Non-numeric inputs (will raise ValueError)


## How to Run

Simply execute the Python file:
```bash
python week_1.py
```

## Possible Improvements

Future versions could include:
- Support for more operations (exponents, modulu
s)                                              - Continuous calculations (keeping previous result)
- Better handling of floating-point precision   - GUI interface

# List Operations in Python

This Python script demonstrates various list operations, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and searching for elements.

## Code Overview

The script performs the following operations on a list named `my_list`:

1. **Creates an empty list**
2. **Appends elements** (`10, 20, 30, 40`)
3. **Inserts an element** (`15` at the second position)
4. **Extends the list** with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. **Removes the last element**
6. **Sorts the list** in ascending order
7. **Finds the index** of the value `30`

## Final Output

After executing all operations, the index of `30` is printed:

```python
Index of 30: 3
```

## How to Run

1. Save the script as week_2.py`.
2. Execute it using Python




## Requirements

- Python 3.x
