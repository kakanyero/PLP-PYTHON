# Simple Python Calculator

A basic command-line calculator that performs arithmetic operations based on user input.

## Features

- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles invalid operations gracefully
- Prevents division by zero errors
- Cleans user input automatically
- Displays results in a clear format

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment (Python 3.x required)
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. Choose an operation (+, -, *, /)
5. View the result

Example:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

## Error Handling

The program handles:
- Invalid operations (shows error message)
- Division by zero (shows error message)
- Non-numeric inputs (will raise ValueError)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

Simply execute the Python file:
```bash
python week_1.py
```

## Possible Improvements

Future versions could include:
- Support for more operations (exponents, modulus)
- Continuous calculations (keeping previous result)
- Better handling of floating-point precision
- GUI interface
